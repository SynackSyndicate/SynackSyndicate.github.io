      <description>Hi all! Welcome to my website. During your stay here, you’ll find my cybersecurity work through various different platforms. Most of them will be hands-on-labs. I do both Blue and Red Team practical labs. Also, feel free to connect on LinkedIn or Discord, I’m always down to make new friends!
My goal and intent is to provide real experiences that I’ve have gone through and to help others who are also in my position beginning their route in cybersecurity.</description>
