      <description>Threat Intelligence is so vast and conceptual that it really is hard to grasp what exactly it is. Some say, it&amp;rsquo;s reading and writing reports; others might say, actively looking at the cyberlandscape and determine trends; and some might also not know what exactly what they do.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my perspective, a good Cyber Threat Intelligence Team (CTI) provides an organization confident research of the landscape to determine better business decisions. Do they research and write reports?</description>

      <description>Hi all! Welcome to my website. During your stay here, you’ll find my cybersecurity work through various different platforms. Most of them will be hands-on-labs. I do both Blue and Red Team practical labs. Also, feel free to connect on LinkedIn or Discord, I’m always down to make new friends!
My goal and intent is to provide real experiences that I’ve have gone through and to help others who are also in my position beginning their route in cybersecurity.</description>
